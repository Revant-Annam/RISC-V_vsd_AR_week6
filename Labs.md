## Day 1 Labs: 'picorv32a' Synthesis & Flop Ratio
This lab focuses on running the 'picorv32a' design through the OpenLANE synthesis flow and analyzing the resulting cell distribution.

### 1. Run 'picorv32a' Design Synthesis
**Commands:**
```bash
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
docker
./flow.tcl -interactive
package require openlane 0.9
prep -design picorv32a
run_synthesis
exit
exit
````

### 2\. Calculate the Flop Ratio

**Calculation:**
$$ \text{Flop Ratio} = \frac{\text{Number of D Flip Flops}}{\text{Total Number of Cells}} = \frac{1613}{14876} \approx 0.1084 $$
$$ \text{Percentage of DFFs} = \text{Flop Ratio} \times 100 \approx 10.84 \text{ \%} $$

### 4\. Edit 'config.tcl' to Include Custom Cell

Added `set ::env(LIB_SYNTH)`, `set ::env(LIB_FASTEST)`, `set ::env(LIB_SLOWEST)`, `set ::env(LIB_TYPICAL)`, and `set ::env(EXTRA_LEFS)` to `config.tcl`.

### 5\. Run Synthesis & Optimize
